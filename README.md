# Food ML Project

Welcome to the **Food ML Project**! This project includes three core components: **Diet Planner**, **Dish Image Classifier**, and **Fruit/Vegetable Quality Classifier**, all of which are powered by machine learning.

## Project Overview

- **Diet Planner**: A personalized diet planning tool that designs meal plans based on individual profiles, taking into account factors such as age, weight, dietary restrictions, and fitness goals.
- **Dish Image Classifier**: An AI-powered classifier that identifies unlabeled dishes from images and provides detailed nutritional information.
- **Quality Classifier**: A quality assessment tool that verifies the edibility of fresh produce, distinguishing between consumable and spoiled fruits and vegetables.
