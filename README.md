# Food ML Project

Welcome to the **Food ML Project**! This project includes three core components: **Diet Planner**, **Dish Image Classifier**, and **Fruit/Vegetable Quality Classifier**, all of which are powered by machine learning.

## Project Overview

- **Diet Planner**: A personalized diet planning tool that designs meal plans based on individual profiles, taking into account factors such as age, weight, dietary restrictions, and fitness goals.
- **Dish Image Classifier**: An AI-powered classifier that identifies unlabeled dishes from images and provides detailed nutritional information.
- **Quality Classifier**: A quality assessment tool that verifies the edibility of fresh produce, distinguishing between consumable and spoiled fruits and vegetables.

## Note
For Dish classifier and Quality classifier, we had original code in .ipynb(Jupiter notebook), We have copied main parts of the code and converted it into .py. We haven't uploaded the trained model,
in practicce we are directly calling saved trained model in web app for predictions.
